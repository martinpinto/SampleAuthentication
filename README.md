# Sample Registration and Login 

![Screen1](https://github.com/martinpinto/SampleAuthentication/blob/master/screen1.png)

Welcome to this sample registration and login repository!

## How is this repository structured?

This sample repository is structured for simplification purposes into two parts: 

* backend
* frontend.

Ideally this repository would be split into separate repositories as git submodules.
The frontend folder contains all the frontend logic and forms written in vue.js. The backend folder contains the login and registration backend logic written in node.js.
